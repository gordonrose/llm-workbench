# 0017 Organize Scripts By Owner, Domain, And Capability

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-06-19

## Context

The script tree grew while the harness was primarily solving chat workbench
problems. Before this migration, many chat-owned scripts lived under
`scripts/shared/git/`, while their metadata said they were owned by `00.chat`
with `domain: git`.

That mismatch makes ownership harder to reason about:

- folder paths imply these scripts are shared Git primitives
- metadata says many are chat workbench lifecycle scripts
- smoke tests live far away from the scripts they validate
- future growth will add many more scripts, making flat folders harder to scan

The metadata backfill made the ownership boundary visible. The next step is to
make the folder layout match that boundary without breaking existing workflows.

## Decision

Move toward a script layout organized by:

1. real owner layer
2. domain
3. capability folder

The target shape is:

```txt
scripts/
  00.chat/
    git/
      cleanup-empty-chat-branches/
        script.sh
        smoke-test.sh
      verify-chat-ready-to-merge-local-main/
        script.sh
        smoke-test.sh
    session-log/
      record-chat-commit/
        script.sh
        smoke-test.sh
    startup/
      start-chat-session/
        script.sh
        smoke-test.sh

  harness/
    governance/
      run-governed-script/
        script.sh
        smoke-test.sh
      check-artifact-metadata-headers/
        script.sh
        smoke-test.sh
```

Keep executable capability files under `scripts/`, not under `.agentic/`,
because scripts are runnable implementation artifacts. Use metadata headers to
preserve owner/domain details inside each file.

The migration was performed by capability. Old compatibility paths were removed
after workflows, package scripts, smoke tests, bootstrap audits, and governed
runner allowlists pointed at canonical paths.

Historical references to retired paths should say what previously lived there
and point to the current canonical capability path. Do not keep retired files
solely to make historical examples work.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Govern The Layout

- Add or update the metadata header standard to name capability folders as the
  preferred long-term shape.
- Teach bootstrap/audit scripts to understand both old paths and capability
  folders.
- Require moved scripts to keep metadata headers at the new path.
- During migration, keep old paths as wrappers that delegate to new capability
  scripts. Retire those wrappers after canonical paths own the live surface.

### Phase 2: Pilot One Capability

Pilot with `cleanup-empty-chat-branches` because it has:

- clear `00.chat` ownership
- `domain: git`
- a public command surface
- a previous shared implementation under `scripts/shared/git/`
- a matching smoke test

Target pilot shape:

```txt
scripts/00.chat/git/cleanup-empty-chat-branches/
  script.sh
  smoke-test.sh
```

Compatibility paths initially remained during migration:

```txt
scripts/shared/git/cleanup-empty-chat-branches.sh
scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-cleanup-empty-chat-branches.sh
```

The wrappers must be thin, metadata-tagged compatibility scripts.

- governed runner update:

- retired compatibility wrappers:

  `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-local-convergence-verifier.sh`
- direct callers migrated:

- governed runner update:

  wrappers were later removed from the allowlist.

Retired shared git inventory after commit-boundary batch:

The remaining `scripts/shared/git/*.sh` files at that point declared
`owner: 00.chat`. None were classified as genuinely cross-layer shared Git
primitives by metadata. They were retired after reconciliation:

1. Retired superseded isolated chat branch execution helpers:

   - `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-with-chat-branch.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/stage-active-worktree-paths.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/with-chat-branch.sh`

   These belonged to the pre-ADR-0011 commit-boundary model. The safe
   reconciliation pass found no current workflow, bootstrap, install, recovery,
   or governed runner dependency that still needed isolated command execution.
   Prefer `scripts/00.chat/recovery/import-active-paths-to-chat-worktree/script.sh`
   for wrong-worktree recovery imports.

Retirement result:

- no `scripts/shared/git/*.sh` files remain as live source files
- canonical chat behavior lives under `scripts/00.chat/...`
- `scripts/shared/harness/` remains the shared governance script surface

Compatibility wrapper retirement map:

Some old paths have more than one blocker. For example, a superseded helper can
also remain in the governed runner allowlist until that runner points at a
canonical replacement.

Governed runner canonical-surface batch result:

- `scripts/shared/harness/run-governed-script.sh --list` now advertises
  canonical `scripts/00.chat/...` paths for chat-owned capabilities.
- old `scripts/shared/...` paths remain accepted by the runner as compatibility
  inputs while existing sessions and external callers migrate.
- agent-facing examples in chat start, before-commit, shared process, command
  docs, and closeout prompt text now show canonical approved-action targets.
- governed command drift detection now scans canonical `scripts/00.chat/...`
  approval-sensitive references and recognizes multiline approved-action
  commands.

Bootstrap/install compatibility audit result:

- The bootstrap audit currently treats a path as required when it is reachable
  from installed or agent-facing seed surfaces. Required does not mean the path
  is permanently canonical.
- Package scripts in `package.json` are the stable human-facing command surface
  for a bootstrapped workbench.
- Canonical `scripts/00.chat/...` implementations are now required for the
  actual chat capabilities.
- `scripts/shared/harness/run-governed-script.sh` and the deterministic harness
  checks remain required shared process primitives, not chat wrappers.
- Retired `scripts/shared/chat/...` and `scripts/shared/git/...` paths remain
  only as historical documentation references or negative test fixtures.
- The audit's "validation and compatibility candidates" section is not the
  install-critical path. Those files are either smoke-test wrappers, old-path
  compatibility wrappers, or validation helpers that can be retired after their
  canonical tests and public install expectations are updated.
- `scripts/00.chat/upstream/ensure-llm-workbench-repo/script.sh` owns upstream
  workbench repository availability checks for reusable-lesson promotion.

Upstream repo availability batch result:

- canonical implementation:
  `scripts/00.chat/upstream/ensure-llm-workbench-repo/script.sh`
- capability README:
  `scripts/00.chat/upstream/ensure-llm-workbench-repo/README.md`
- retired compatibility wrapper:
  `scripts/shared/chat/ensure-llm-workbench-repo.sh`
- governed runner update:
  `scripts/shared/harness/run-governed-script.sh --list` advertises the
  canonical upstream path and rejects the old shared path.
- direct callers migrated:
  `.agentic/harness/standards/governed-script-permissions.md`

Bootstrap compatibility classifications:

1. Public install surface to keep:

   - `package.json` `chat`
   - `package.json` `chat:list`
   - `package.json` `chat:new`
   - `package.json` `chat:close`
   - `package.json` `chat:audit-bootstrap`
   - `package.json` `chat:audit-layer-migration`
   - `package.json` `chat:cleanup-empty-branches`
   - `package.json` `chat:commit-log-summary`
   - `package.json` `chat:record-main-refresh-conflict`
   - `package.json` `chat:report-workspaces`
   - `package.json` `chat:smoke-package-scripts`

2. Shared governance primitives to keep:

   - `scripts/shared/harness/run-governed-script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/harness/check-artifact-metadata-headers.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/harness/check-deterministic-process-drift.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/harness/check-governed-script-command-drift.sh`

3. Validation-only compatibility candidates:

   These are not currently required by the bootstrap seed graph. Keep them
   until the corresponding canonical behavior, smoke tests, or install
   expectations are explicit enough to retire old-path wrappers:

   - none currently identified

4. Retired validation-only Track A wrappers:

   These old wrappers were the final validation-only bootstrap/install
   compatibility candidates. They were removed after smoke fixtures and
   operative references moved to canonical `scripts/00.chat/...` paths and the
   bootstrap audit stayed clean:

   - `scripts/shared/chat/ensure-chat-worktree.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/worktree/ensure-chat-worktree/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/chat/estimate-chat-cost.js` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/metrics/estimate-chat-cost/script.js`
   - `scripts/shared/chat/record-main-refresh-conflict.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/session-log/record-main-refresh-conflict/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/chat/request-initialization/start-chat-session.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-chat-session/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/cleanup-empty-chat-branches.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/git/cleanup-empty-chat-branches/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/promote-preflight-refresh.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/main-refresh/apply-rehearsed-refresh/script.sh`

5. Retired validation-only chat helper wrappers:

   These old `scripts/shared/chat/...` wrappers were validation-only
   compatibility paths with direct canonical replacements. They were removed
   after confirming no operative references remained and the bootstrap audit
   stayed clean:

   - `scripts/shared/chat/discover-codex-session-log.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/transcript/discover-codex-session-log/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/chat/register-codex-session-log.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/transcript/register-codex-session-log/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/chat/request-initialization/read-current-chat-log.sh`
     wraps `scripts/00.chat/session-log/read-current-chat-log/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/chat/update-chat-log.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/session-log/update-chat-log/script.sh`

6. Retired validation-only classification wrappers:

   These old request-initialization wrappers were validation-only
   compatibility paths with direct canonical replacements. They were removed
   after confirming no operative references remained and the bootstrap audit
   stayed clean:

   - `scripts/shared/chat/request-initialization/classify-task.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/classification/classify-task/script.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/chat/request-initialization/check-classify-task-fixtures.sh`
     wraps `scripts/00.chat/classification/classify-task/check-fixtures.sh`

7. Retired validation-only smoke wrappers:

   The old `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-*.sh` wrappers below each forward to
   a canonical `scripts/00.chat/.../smoke-test.sh` file. They were validation
   compatibility wrappers, not install-critical runtime paths, and were removed
   after confirming the bootstrap audit remained clean:

   - `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-chat-worktree-session.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-chat-session/smoke-test.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-cleanup-empty-chat-branches.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/git/cleanup-empty-chat-branches/smoke-test.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-commit-prerequisites.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/session-log/check-commit-prerequisites/smoke-test.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-commitlog-deletions.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/session-log/check-commitlog-deletions/smoke-test.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-local-convergence-verifier.sh` wraps
     `scripts/00.chat/local-merge/verify-chat-ready-to-merge-local-main/smoke-test.sh`
   - `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-main-refresh-dirty-classifier.sh` wraps

Retirement rule:

Remove an old path only when all of these are true:

- no workflow, standard, checklist, ADR, script, command dispatcher, bootstrap
  audit, public alias, or install surface references it as the operative path
- the governed runner either allows the canonical path or no longer needs to
  run the capability
- a canonical `scripts/00.chat/...` path or an explicit public alias owns the
  behavior
- bootstrap audit reports no unclassified candidates after the removal
- any removal that deletes files is proposed as its own governed slice

Closeout command batch result:

- canonical implementation:
  `scripts/00.chat/closeout/build-closeout-prompt/script.sh`
- canonical command entrypoint:
  `scripts/00.chat/command/close/script.sh`
- retired command compatibility wrapper:
  `scripts/shared/chat/commands/close.sh` was removed after package scripts and
  canonical command paths became the public command surface.

New-session command batch result:

- canonical implementation:
  `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-new-chat/script.sh`
- canonical command entrypoint:
  `scripts/00.chat/command/new/script.sh`
- retired command compatibility wrapper:
  `scripts/shared/chat/commands/new.sh` was removed after package scripts and
  canonical command paths became the public command surface.
- dispatcher migration:
  `scripts/00.chat/command/dispatcher/script.sh` now discovers commands from
  canonical `scripts/00.chat/command/<name>/script.sh` paths instead of
  `scripts/shared/chat/commands`.

Auto-start missing session batch result:

- canonical implementation:
  `scripts/00.chat/startup/auto-start-missing-session/script.sh`
- capability README:
  `scripts/00.chat/startup/auto-start-missing-session/README.md`
- retired request-initialization compatibility wrapper:
  `scripts/shared/chat/request-initialization/auto-start-missing-session.sh`
  was removed after the governed runner and dispatcher smoke test moved to the
  canonical startup path.
- validation:
  `scripts/00.chat/command/dispatcher/smoke-test.sh` covers opening-prompt
  auto-start behavior, including normal session creation and the bare `new`
  guard.

Start chat session batch result:

- canonical implementation:
  `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-chat-session/script.sh`
- capability README:
  `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-chat-session/README.md`
- canonical smoke test:
  `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-chat-session/smoke-test.sh`
- retired request-initialization compatibility wrapper:
  `scripts/shared/chat/request-initialization/start-chat-session.sh` was
  removed after smoke fixtures, downstream references, and public startup
  instructions moved to the canonical startup path.
- smoke-test compatibility wrapper:
  `scripts/shared/git/smoke-test-chat-worktree-session.sh` was retired after
  callers migrated to the canonical startup smoke-test path.
- direct callers migrated:
  `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-new-chat/script.sh`,
  `.agentic/00.chat/workflows/chat-start.md`, and related script metadata now
  point at the canonical startup path.
- follow-up:
  Revisit `CHAT_COPY_PROMPT` after the current script organization stream. It is
  terminal handoff behavior, not the chat startup contract. Consider replacing
  or wrapping it with a clearer terminal-specific startup packet interface for
  IDE extensions and app integrations.

### Phase 3: Prove Compatibility

For the pilot:

- run the new capability script directly
- run the old shared path
- run the public `npm run chat:*` package script
- run the smoke test from the new path
- run the old smoke-test path wrapper
- run the bootstrap file-set audit
- run metadata header checks

Only after all compatibility checks pass should further moves be attempted.

### Phase 4: Batch Migrations

Migrate the remaining scripts in batches:

1. `00.chat/startup`
2. `00.chat/session-log`
3. `00.chat/reporting`
4. `00.chat/git`
5. `harness/governance`
6. `harness/metadata`
7. `harness/validation`

Each batch should keep old-path wrappers until no workflow, smoke test,
bootstrap rule, or downstream repo depends on the old path.

### Phase 5: Retire Old Paths

Only remove old compatibility paths after:

- all workflows reference new paths
- all governed runner allowlist entries reference new paths
- bootstrap audits pass without old paths
- downstream upstream repo bootstraps have been updated
- a separate explicit cleanup approval is given

## Consequences

The folder tree will become more honest:

- chat workbench scripts will live under `scripts/00.chat/`
- Git will be a domain, not a fake layer
- smoke tests can sit next to the capability they validate
- open-source extraction can copy capability folders instead of guessing across
  broad shared folders

The migration adds short-term duplication because old paths must remain as
wrappers. That cost is intentional: it protects active workflows and downstream
installers while the layout changes.

The harness will need audit updates so dependency checks understand both
current flat paths and the new capability-folder shape during migration.
