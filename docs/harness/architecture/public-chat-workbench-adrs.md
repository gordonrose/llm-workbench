# Public Chat Workbench ADRs

This file is the export manifest for ADRs copied into the public
`llm-workbench` repo.

ADRs are not runtime dependencies. They are copied only when they help a public
reader understand the current reusable chat workbench shape.

## Selection Rule

Add a future ADR to this list when all of these are true:

- it explains reusable chat workbench behavior
- it affects the public bootstrap, install, governance, command, script layout,
  session lifecycle, worktree model, or upstream promotion model
- a public maintainer would need the decision to understand why the workbench is
  shaped this way

Do not add an ADR when it is primarily about:

- source-repo-only history
- non-chat layers such as AWS, education, product, or customer-specific work
- temporary migration mechanics that no longer affect public usage
- private paths, local environment details, or internal-only workflows

## Manifest

Keep this list path-based so the bootstrap planner can copy exactly these ADRs.
