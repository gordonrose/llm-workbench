# Adapting To Your Repo

The workbench is intentionally small at the root and detailed in the harness
folders.

## Keep AGENTS.md Small

Use `AGENTS.md` as a router. Put detailed rules in workflows, standards,
checklists, and scripts.

## Add A Layer Deliberately

If your repo needs product, infrastructure, docs, or education governance, add
a layer under `.agentic/` and update `AGENTS.md` only with the routing summary.

## Prefer Scripts For Repeatable Checks

If a process can be checked deterministically, add or update a governed script
instead of relying only on prose.

## Keep Session History Local To The Repo

Do not import another repo's `commitLogs/`. The first chat in your repo creates
your repo's own session history inside the chat-owned worktree.

## Promote Reusable Lessons Upstream

When a target repo teaches you something reusable about the workbench, promote
that lesson back to `llm-workbench` instead of letting each repo drift.
