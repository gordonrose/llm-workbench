# Install

## Requirements

- Git
- Bash
- Node.js and npm for the `llm-wb` CLI

## Install Into A Target Repo

The intended public install path starts from the target Git repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/target/repo

npx llm-wb init --dry-run
npx llm-wb init
```

Dry-run mode prints the package and file plan without writing. Apply mode
refuses to write when the plan contains conflicts.

The installer copies the workbench harness into the target Git repo. It does not
copy `commitLogs/` from the workbench repo, overwrite existing assistant
instruction files, or replace unrelated `package.json` scripts. Existing
instruction files receive a managed `llm-workbench` block; package files are
merged instead of overwritten.

For an empty Git repo with no first commit yet:

```bash
npx llm-wb init --init-commit
```

That creates an install commit after the clean plan is applied.
`--init-commit` is only for repos with no existing `HEAD`; existing repos should
review and commit the install changes through their normal process. The install
commit stages only workbench-owned files, managed instruction blocks,
`package.json` when workbench scripts were added, and the workbench manifests.

Apply mode writes:

```txt
.llm-workbench/
  install-manifest.tsv
  lock.json
  manifest.json
```

The TSV manifest is kept for uninstall compatibility. `lock.json` records the
installed package version. `manifest.json` records which files, instruction
blocks, and package scripts are managed by `llm-workbench` for future updates.

Target installs do not copy the upstream `.agentic/01.harness` maintenance
tree. Reusable harness lessons should be promoted back to `llm-workbench`
instead of creating source-specific harness governance in each target repo.

## Adopt Existing Workbench Files

Use adoption when a repo already contains workbench files from an earlier manual
copy, bootstrap, or source-repo migration:

```bash
npx llm-wb@latest adopt --dry-run
npx llm-wb@latest adopt --apply
```

Dry run prints classifications without writing:

```txt
ADOPT path              file matches the packaged workbench
CREATE path             file is missing and can be created
PATCH_BLOCK path        repo-owned instruction file can receive a managed block
ADOPT_BLOCK path        existing managed block matches the package
DIFF path               existing file differs and needs a human decision
DIFF_BLOCK path         existing managed block differs
LOCAL_ONLY path         target repo file is not workbench-managed
```

Apply is refused while any `DIFF` or `DIFF_BLOCK` remains. Adoption does not
claim ownership of `.git/`, `commitLogs/`, `node_modules/`, or existing
`.llm-workbench/` state.

## Update Or Roll Back

Use update after install or adopt has written `.llm-workbench/manifest.json`:

```bash
npx llm-wb@latest update --dry-run
npx llm-wb@latest update --apply
```

Update compares three things:

- the checksum recorded in `.llm-workbench/manifest.json`
- the current target repo file or managed block
- the file or managed block in the package version being run

If the target still matches the recorded checksum, update can replace the
managed file, patch the managed block, or refresh a managed package script. If
the target changed locally, update reports a conflict and refuses apply.

Rollback uses the same command with an older package version:

```bash
npx llm-wb@0.1.0-beta.0 update --dry-run
npx llm-wb@0.1.0-beta.0 update --apply
```

Rollback obeys the same conflict rules as forward update.

## Verify The Install

From the target repo:

```bash
npx llm-wb list
npx llm-wb sessions list
```

`llm-wb list` lists available installed workbench commands. `llm-wb sessions
list` lists active chat sessions and branches. Both commands should run without
requiring a current chat session.

The public-beta contract is summarized in `docs/public-beta-contract.md`.

## First Chat

Open the target repo with your coding agent. The first chat startup should
create that repo's own `commitLogs/` tree inside the chat-owned worktree and
use the target repo as the source of truth.

For tools that prefer machine-readable startup packets:

```bash
npx llm-wb new --json "Describe the prompt"
```

The JSON packet includes the session log, chat-owned worktree, lifecycle
workflow, latest context-packet references, and first prompt.

## Transcript Metadata

The workbench stores neutral transcript metadata:

- `transcript_provider`
- `transcript_path`
- `transcript_bytes`
- `transcript_source`

Codex transcript discovery can populate these fields automatically. Other
providers can supply them when recording a commit:

```bash
CHAT_TRANSCRIPT_PROVIDER=mistral \
CHAT_TRANSCRIPT_BYTES=4096 \
CHAT_TRANSCRIPT_SOURCE="Mistral CLI transcript bytes" \
  bash scripts/00.chat/session-log/record-chat-commit/script.sh \
    <commit-sha> \
    "Commit subject" \
    "Commit summary"
```

Missing transcript metrics do not block portable mode. Set
`CHAT_TRANSCRIPT_METRICS_MODE=strict` when a repo wants commit recording to fail
without transcript metrics.

## Uninstall

From the target repo:

```bash
bash scripts/uninstall.sh --dry-run .
bash scripts/uninstall.sh --apply .
```

Uninstall reads `.llm-workbench/install-manifest.tsv` from the target repo. It
removes only workbench-owned files, package scripts, and managed instruction
blocks recorded in that manifest. It should not remove target repo product code,
unrelated package scripts, or committed session history unless you explicitly
clean those files yourself.
