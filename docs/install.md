# Install

## Requirements

- Git
- Bash
- Node.js and npm for the `npm run chat:*` command surface

## Install Into A Target Repo

From the `llm-workbench` repo:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh /path/to/target/repo
```

The installer copies the workbench harness into the target Git repo. It does
not copy `commitLogs/` from the workbench repo.

## Verify The Install

From the target repo:

```bash
npm run chat:list
```

The command should run without requiring a chat session.

## First Chat

Open the target repo with your coding agent. The first chat startup should
create that repo's own `commitLogs/` tree inside the chat-owned worktree and
use the target repo as the source of truth.

## Uninstall

From the `llm-workbench` repo:

```bash
bash scripts/uninstall.sh /path/to/target/repo
```

Uninstall removes harness files that were installed by the workbench. It should
not remove target repo product code or committed session history unless you
explicitly choose to clean those files yourself.
