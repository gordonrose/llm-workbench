# llm-workbench

`llm-workbench` is a portable chat harness for governed agentic development.

It gives a Git repo a repeatable way to start work in chat-owned branches and
worktrees, record session logs, run commit gates, refresh from local `main`, and
promote reusable lessons back upstream.

## What You Get

- chat startup and session logs under `commitLogs/`
- chat-owned worktrees for implementation work
- public `npm run chat:*` commands
- governed script execution for repeatable helper commands
- local merge readiness and main-refresh checks
- onboarding docs for every chat script folder

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <llm-workbench-repo-url>
cd llm-workbench
npm run chat:list
```

To install the workbench into another Git repo:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh /path/to/target/repo
```

Then open that target repo with your coding agent and follow its `AGENTS.md`.

## Important Boundaries

The workbench does not push to remotes, rewrite history, discard local work, or
delete branches without explicit human approval.

The first chat in a target repo creates that repo's own `commitLogs/` inside
the chat-owned worktree. The workbench does not copy session history from
another repo.
