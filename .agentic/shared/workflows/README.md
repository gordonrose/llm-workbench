# Shared Workflows

Shared workflows govern cross-layer process that does not belong to one
specialized layer. Chat lifecycle ownership belongs in `.agentic/00.chat/`.

## Workflows

- `change-shared-process.md` - change cross-layer git, commit, merge, handoff,
  deployment, release, or context-preservation process.
- `capability-resolution-workflow.md` - propose or resolve capabilities before
  implementation.
