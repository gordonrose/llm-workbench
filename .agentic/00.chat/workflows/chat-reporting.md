# Chat Reporting Workflow

## Use When

Use this when the user asks for summaries, metrics, or reports derived from chat
session logs.

## Purpose

Own on-demand reports from chat session logs.

## Source Evidence

- Individual session logs under `commitLogs/` are durable source evidence.
- The retired aggregate path `commitLogs/README.md` is not maintained.
- Report artifacts are temporary or explicitly requested outputs, not automatic
  branch bookkeeping.

## On-Demand Summary

Use the chat-layer reporting skill for human-oriented summary work:

```txt
.agentic/00.chat/skills/session-summary.md
```

Use the script for deterministic aggregate metrics:

```bash
bash scripts/01.harness/run-governed-script.sh --approved-action scripts/00.chat/reporting/generate-commit-log-summary/script.sh
```

To write a file, require an explicit output path:

```bash
bash scripts/01.harness/run-governed-script.sh --approved-action scripts/00.chat/reporting/generate-commit-log-summary/script.sh --output <path>
```

## Rules

- Do not recreate tracked `commitLogs/README.md`.
- Treat individual session logs as source evidence.
- Write file artifacts only to explicit user-requested paths.
- Prefer stdout for quick inspection.
- If the requested report needs interpretation beyond deterministic metrics,
  cite the source session logs used.
- If a requested report would need new persistent generated files, stop and ask
  whether the harness should define that artifact first.
