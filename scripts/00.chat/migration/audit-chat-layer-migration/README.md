# Audit Chat Layer Migration

`script.sh` checks that the canonical chat-layer files exist and reports
remaining compatibility references.

The audit distinguishes current canonical requirements from historical or
policy references. It does not treat old session logs as migration blockers.

Use this after moving workflows, checklists, standards, or scripts so the next
agent can see whether the chat layer still relies on compatibility paths.
