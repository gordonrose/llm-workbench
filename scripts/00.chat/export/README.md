# Export Scripts

Export scripts create portable review bundles from chat-owned worktrees.

Use this domain when the user needs to hand the active chat worktree, or only
its changed files, to another model, engineer, or verification environment.
The export capability owns the selection and manifest semantics. Zip is only
the default transport format for the resulting bundle.
