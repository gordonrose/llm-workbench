# Create Worktree Bundle

This internal helper writes portable zip bundles for chat worktree exports.

Public callers should use:

```bash
npm run chat -- download repo
npm run chat -- download repo diff
```

The helper is intentionally dependency-light: it uses Node built-in modules and
Git only, so exported `llm-workbench` installs do not depend on a system `zip`
binary.
