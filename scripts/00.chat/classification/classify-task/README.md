# Classify Task

`script.sh` reads the opening task summary and prints the session routing
metadata used by chat startup:

- `Layer`
- `Mode`
- `Workflow`
- `Reason`

The output is intentionally simple text so shell startup can consume it without
extra dependencies.

`check-fixtures.sh` verifies the classifier against `fixtures.tsv`. Update the
fixtures when a new durable routing phrase should be recognized.

This capability does not grant write permission, create a branch, or decide
that unclear governance is safe. If the classifier cannot produce a reliable
route, the chat startup workflow must stop and ask for clarification or harness
coverage.
