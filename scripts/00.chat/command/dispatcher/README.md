# Chat Command Dispatcher

This capability owns the chat command dispatcher.

The dispatcher is the small command-line router for chat commands. It accepts a
command name such as `list`, `new`, or `close`, validates the name, finds the
matching executable under `scripts/00.chat/command/<name>/script.sh`, and
transfers control to that command script.

The dispatcher is not the implementation of each chat action. The subcommand
scripts remain separate so each command can evolve independently.

## Files

- `script.sh` is the canonical dispatcher entrypoint.
- `<command>/script.sh` files are canonical command entrypoints.
- `smoke-test.sh` validates the dispatcher and core chat subcommands in a
  throwaway repository.

The old `scripts/shared/chat/commands/` compatibility wrappers have been
retired. Public callers should use `package.json` `chat:*` scripts; governed
callers should use canonical `scripts/00.chat/command/...` paths.
