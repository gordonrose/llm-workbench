# New Command

`script.sh` is the canonical entrypoint for the public `chat:new` command. It
delegates to `scripts/00.chat/startup/start-new-chat/script.sh`.

The command keeps the public interface small: humans ask for a new chat, and
startup owns branch creation, worktree creation, session-log initialization,
chat lifecycle metadata, and terminal handoff. Prompt-level routing and context
selection are resolved later from the current request, repo assistant
instructions, and any repo-provided context router if one exists.

This command can create branches, worktrees, and session-log files through the
startup engine.
