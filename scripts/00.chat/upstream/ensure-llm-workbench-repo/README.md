# Ensure llm-workbench Repo

This capability verifies that the canonical local upstream workbench repository
exists at `/home/owner/projects/llm-workbench`.

It is used by reusable-lesson promotion work, where this repo discovers a chat
harness lesson and `llm-workbench` owns the reusable implementation.

## Files

- `script.sh` is the canonical helper.
- `scripts/shared/chat/ensure-llm-workbench-repo.sh` has been retired. Older
  governed-runner calls should be updated to this canonical path.

## Behavior

With `--dry-run`, the helper reports what it would clone without touching the
filesystem.

Without `--dry-run`, it creates the parent directory if needed and clones
`git@github.com:gordonrose/llm-workbench.git` into the canonical local path.

If the target path already exists, it must be a Git repository with the expected
origin URL.
