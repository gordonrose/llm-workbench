# Upstream Scripts

Upstream scripts support moving reusable chat-harness lessons into a separate
workbench repository such as `llm-workbench`.

They do not decide what should be open sourced. They provide deterministic
checks around local upstream repo availability so the promotion workflow can
stay explicit.

## Capabilities

- `bootstrap-llm-workbench-repo/` plans how the public workbench shell and
  canonical chat harness files would be materialized into a target upstream
  repo. Its current implementation is dry-run only.
- `check-llm-workbench-contract/` runs fast static checks for the public-beta
  standalone/provider-neutral contract.
- `ensure-llm-workbench-repo/` checks the source-side canonical local clone of
  `gordonrose/llm-workbench`.
